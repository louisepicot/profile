              <h3>L'Enlèvement de Michel Houellebecq</h3>
              <p>
                The writer Michel Houellebecq  has a calm and uneventful life, he walks in his neighborhood and talks with his friends. But one day three men followed him to his building, tied up and kidnapped him.
                Perplexed about the wishes of its captors who seem themselves in the uncertainty of their project, they will all find themselves accommodated in a house of a retired couple, in a friendly and
                family semi-captivity where the sensibilities of each will be update, punctuated by the
                gloomy and folkloric moods of the famous writer.
                The film was inspired by a rumour which occurred while Houellebecq was promoting his novel The Map and the Territory. For some time, he appeared to give no signs of life, which made newspapers in France speculate that he had been kidnapped. In reality he only had some trouble with his Internet connection.
